# Mantitor
A simplified version of a TOR-like Onion Routing system as described in the paper by Dingledine et al.

The purpose of this project is to get some hands on experience building a substantial
distributed application running on a multi-process computing infrastructure, then to use it
to study networking. It also has a secondary purpose of implementing a program using
network programming (sockets) and processes (fork, in stage 1) and Unix development tools
(make).
